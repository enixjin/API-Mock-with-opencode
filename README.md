# OpenAPI Mock Server

An Electron-based desktop application for uploading OpenAPI specifications and running mock servers.

> **Note**: This project was entirely created by [opencode](https://opencode.ai) - an AI coding assistant. No human-written code was involved in the development of this application.

## Features

- **Upload OpenAPI Specifications**: Supports both YAML and JSON formats (OpenAPI 2.0, 3.0.x, and 3.1.x)
- **Interactive API Documentation**: Visualize your API specs with Swagger UI
- **Mock Server**: Automatically generates and runs a local HTTP server based on your OpenAPI specification
- **Cross-Platform**: Built with Electron for macOS, Windows, and Linux support

## Tech Stack

- **Electron 28** - Desktop application framework
- **Swagger UI 5.31** - API documentation viewer (supports OpenAPI 3.1.x)
- **Node.js** - Backend runtime
- **js-yaml** - YAML parsing support

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd electron-openapi-mock

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the application
npm start
```

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Click "Upload OpenAPI YAML or JSON" button
3. Select your OpenAPI specification file
4. The app will:
   - Validate the specification
   - Display the API documentation in the Swagger UI tab
   - Start a mock server at `http://localhost:7070`

```

## Development

### Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create distributable packages in the `dist/` directory.

### Testing

A sample OpenAPI specification is included (`test/fixtures/test-openapi.json`) for testing purposes.

## Mock Server

The mock server runs on port **7070** and:
- Matches incoming requests against the OpenAPI spec paths
- Returns example responses defined in the spec
- Supports path parameters
- Returns 404 for undefined paths

## Configuration

No additional configuration required. The application automatically:
- Parses YAML and JSON OpenAPI specifications
- Validates version fields (swagger or openapi)
- Cleans and serializes specs for proper IPC communication

## Troubleshooting

### "Unable to render this definition" Error

If you see this error, ensure your OpenAPI specification includes a valid version field:
- OpenAPI 2.0: `swagger: "2.0"`
- OpenAPI 3.0.x: `openapi: "3.0.0"` (or 3.0.1, 3.0.2, etc.)
- OpenAPI 3.1.x: `openapi: "3.1.0"`
